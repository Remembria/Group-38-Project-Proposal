    "Tuberculosis is an airborne respiratory disease that affects mainly the lungs. It can also affect other organs and the symptoms differ depending on where the infection is. Tuberculosis is spread by germs that are released into the air when someone coughs or sneezes. People who breathe in this air may not necessarily become sick because the germs are not active, although they may become sick later on. When the germs are active they divide and attack organ tissues, causing severe threats.  \n",
    "HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is an infection that affects the immune system. Symptoms include flu-like symptoms, chills, rash, and fatigue. HIV spreads through sex and sharing needles. More serious stages of HIV develop into AIDS (Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). There’s currently no cure or vaccine for HIV. \n",
    "Due to a decrease in the functionality of the immune system in HIV patients, they are more likely to become sick with other diseases, especially tuberculosis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Preventive measures and access to healthcare services are of utmost importance when it comes to reducing these infections in the population. However, these factors are not always accessible in every part of the world. In this observational study, we aim to compare the number of deaths due to Tuberculosis across countries in different World Bank income groups, specifically between low-income countries and high-income countries. By doing this we can make conclusions about how much a country invests in healthcare can affect accessibility and the deaths caused by diseases such as Tuberculosis. \n",

In addition, individuals living with HIV are more susceptible to contracting TB due to their weakened immune systems. As a result, our study may reveal a significant association between the country of residence and TB prevalence among HIV-negative patients, highlighting the need for improved healthcare infrastructure in these regions to reduce the burden of TB.\n"
